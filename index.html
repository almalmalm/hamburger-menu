                JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with
                first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many
                non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a
                prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative,
                and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. Read more about JavaScript.

                JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games,
                in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling;
                with animation, etc. This article helps you get started with JavaScript and furthers your understanding
                of what is possible.

                JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented
                by Brendan Eich (co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation).
                JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games,
                animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more! JavaScript itself is
                relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core
                JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort.
